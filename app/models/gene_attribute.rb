# A GeneAttribute defines an attribute that must be matched for a Sequence to be classified as a Descriptor::Gene.
# There are two key attributes, sequence, and sequence relationship.  A GeneAttribute will return all sequences
# who are the object of a taxon name relationship whose subject is Sequence and whose Type is #sequence_relationship_type
#
# @!attribute descriptor_id
#   @return [Integer]
#      the descriptor id (Gene) that this attribute defines
#
# @!attribute sequence_id
#   @return [Integer]
#      the sequence id (Gene), defines the nucleotides in the attribute
#
# @!attribute sequence_relationship_type
#   @return [String]
#      a SequenceRelationship#type, defines how the sequence was used in this attribute
#
# ! Deprecated?
# @!attribute controlled_vocabulary_term_id
#   @return [Integer]
#      not yet implemented, intent/idea is to define a subclass of CVT that represents GO terms.
#
# @!attribute project_id
#   @return [Integer]
#   the project ID
